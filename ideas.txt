Experiments:
For plurality, IRV, and Borda:
Design a realistic voting game/profile
Test the prompts
Vary agent type (truthful vs neutral vs manipulative)
How much information the agent gets
3*3*2=27 (3 rules x 3 agent types x 2 types of information)


Evaluate using Kendall Tau
Or maybe binary: truthful or no

Baseline is everyone is truthful


Next steps
Are the voting rules resistant to LLM manipulation
Does the outcome change
Have the LLM write down a two-three sentence plan, for why it’s voting
5 predefined categories: collusive, truthful, strategic,
Clustering
One agent for each voter?
We can introduce some inter-voter interactions
See if agents learn to collude each other
