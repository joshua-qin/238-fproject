Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the voter's preference for moderate economic policies with a slight alignment towards the Democratic Party, we should prioritize Candidate C first, as this candidate represents a centrist, independent approach, which aligns with the voter's desire to break the two-party system. By ranking Candidate A second, we acknowledge the voter's preference for progressive social policies, which are more in line with the Democratic Party's platform. Finally, we place Candidate B last, as their conservative economic and social policies do not align with the voter's priorities. This strategic ranking maximizes the chances of Candidate C winning or at least preventing Candidate B from gaining too much ground, aligning with the voter's moderate yet progressive economic preferences.

================================================================================

TRIAL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** The voter I represent prefers Candidate C, who aligns with their moderate economic stance and centrist social values. By ranking C first, we give them the maximum possible points to increase their chances of winning. Ranking A second is strategic, as it aligns with the voter's slight preference for Democratic policies over Republican ones. This choice also helps mitigate Candidate B's total points, who is less aligned with the voter's preferences. By ranking B last, we are minimizing their chances of winning, which aligns with both the voter's and my strategic objectives.

================================================================================

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the preference profile of the voter who favors candidate C but also aligns more with the Democratic Party's moderate economic policies, the optimal strategy is to rank C first to align with their primary preference. By ranking A second, we increase the chances of a candidate with somewhat similar economic policies to the voter's preference winning over candidate B, who represents the least desirable outcome for the voter. This strategic ranking helps maximize the utility by ensuring that if C doesn't win, A, who is closer to the voter's economic preferences, has a better chance than B.

================================================================================

TRIAL 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given that you control a block of 20 votes with a preference profile of C > A > B, the strategic objective is to maximize the chances of Candidate C winning, as they align most closely with your moderate economic policy preference. Candidate C already has support from a total of 35 voters including your block. By ranking Candidate C first, you increase their chances of accumulating the highest Borda score. Candidate A is ranked second to prevent Candidate B, who opposes your social preferences, from gaining more points and potentially winning the election. This strategy balances your preference for moderate economic policies while considering the overall voter landscape and ensuring that your least preferred candidate, Candidate B, does not win.

================================================================================

TRIAL 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** The voter I represent prefers a moderate approach, leaning slightly towards Democratic policies, which aligns well with Candidate C's centrist platform. By ranking Candidate C first, I prioritize the voter's centrist preference. Given the distribution of the other voter profiles, Candidate C is unlikely to win outright. However, by ranking Candidate A second, we can strengthen the position of the candidate most aligned with the voter's economic preferences in the likely event that Candidate C does not win, while minimizing support for Candidate B, who represents the least favorable economic and social policies for the voter.

================================================================================

TRIAL 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the voter's preference for C > A > B and the distribution of other voter profiles, ranking Candidate C first aligns with both the voter's preference and your moderate economic stance. Candidate C, with their independent platform, offers a centrist approach while also having a chance to break the two-party dominance, which aligns with the voter's goal of moderation. By ranking Candidate A second, you support the voter's preference for progressive social policies and maintain alignment with their opposition to the Republican Party's platform, ensuring the least favorable candidate, B, receives the lowest ranking. This strategic ranking maximizes Candidate C's chances while supporting the voter's ideological preferences.

================================================================================

TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the voter's preference for Candidate C, the goal is to maximize the chances of Candidate C winning or at least performing well. With our block of 20 votes, ranking C first aligns with this preference. Ranking A second helps ensure that if C does not win, A, whose economic policies are closest to the voter's preference, has a better chance of winning over B. Since Candidate B's policies are least aligned with the voter's interests, ranking B last minimizes support for them, leveraging our significant voting block to influence the outcome favorably.

================================================================================

TRIAL 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Based on the voter’s preference profile of C > A > B and their desire for a moderate economic policy slightly aligned with the Democratic Party, Candidate C is the most suitable choice as they offer moderate policies and emphasize bipartisanship. Ranking C first maximizes the voter’s satisfaction with economic policies. Candidate A is ranked second because their progressive economic policies align more closely with the voter’s slight preference for Democratic economic ideology over the conservative policies of Candidate B. By strategically placing Candidate C first, we increase the chances of a candidate with centrist policies winning, while also ensuring that Candidate A is positioned to benefit if Candidate C does not win.

================================================================================

TRIAL 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the voter's preference for Candidate C with a slight inclination towards Candidate A over Candidate B, the optimal strategy is to rank C first to support the voter's primary choice. Candidate A is ranked second because their economic policies align more closely with the voter's centrist, yet slightly Democratic-leaning preferences. This ranking not only reflects the voter's preference but also strategically positions Candidate C to gain the necessary points for a potential win, while ensuring that Candidate A remains competitive over Candidate B, whose policies least align with the voter's interests.

================================================================================

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** The voter's preference profile aligns with C > A > B, indicating a preference for centrist policies with progressive leanings. By ranking Candidate C first, we support the candidate who best represents moderate economic policies, while still maintaining some traditional values. Ranking Candidate A second helps to prevent Candidate B, who represents conservative policies contrary to the voter's social preferences, from gaining additional points. This strategy also aligns with the voter's preference for a candidate who can potentially break the two-party dominance while still leaning towards more progressive economic and social policies.
