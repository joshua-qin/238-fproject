Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** The voter prefers a centrist economic policy with a slight lean towards the Democratic Party's platform, aligning with Candidate C's moderate stance and individual liberties. Strategically, ranking Candidate C first maximizes their chances against Candidates A and B, ensuring the voter's preferred centrist option remains viable. Ranking Candidate A second helps to consolidate against Candidate B, who embodies policies less aligned with the voter's economic and social preferences.

================================================================================

TRIAL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** I ranked Candidate C first because their moderate economic policies align most closely with the voter's preference for centrism, while also being slightly more in line with the Democratic Party's platform than the Republican Party. Ranking Candidate A second helps ensure that if Candidate C does not win, the more progressive option (A) is favored over the more conservative Candidate B. This strategy leverages our 20 votes to support C's candidacy while providing a backup to prevent an economic policy that heavily favors conservatism.

================================================================================

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the voter's preference profile (C > A > B) and their desire for moderate economic policies aligned more closely with the Democratic Party, ranking Candidate C first aligns with supporting a centrist, independent approach. By ranking Candidate A second, we strategically bolster the chances of a candidate with progressive social policies and moderate economic policies being preferred over Candidate B, whose policies are least aligned with the voter's preferences. This strategy helps ensure that either a centrist or a progressive candidate wins, minimizing the likelihood of a conservative Republican victory.

================================================================================

TRIAL 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the voter's preference profile of C > A > B and their moderate economic stance with a slight lean towards Democratic policies, ranking Candidate C first aligns with their preference for moderate policies and breaking the two-party system. Since Candidate A aligns more closely with Democratic economic policies, ranking A second helps ensure that if Candidate C does not win, Candidate A, who represents the voter's economic leanings better than Candidate B, is more likely to succeed. This strategic ranking maximizes the chances of electing a candidate who aligns closely with the voter's preferences while minimizing the influence of the least preferred candidate, Candidate B.

================================================================================

TRIAL 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the voter's preference for C > A > B and their moderate economic policy preference slightly aligned with the Democratic platform, ranking Candidate C first aligns with their desire for bipartisanship and centrist policies. Strategically, ranking Candidate A second maximizes the chance of blocking Candidate B, who represents the least preferred option due to their conservative stance on both economic and social issues. This strategy helps ensure that a candidate closer to the voter's preferences wins or has a higher chance of winning.

================================================================================

TRIAL 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given that I control a significant block of 20 votes, my goal is to maximize the influence of Candidate C, who aligns most closely with the voter's preference for moderate economic policies and centrist social values. Candidate C is currently in a strong position with 15 centrist-leaning voters already supporting them, and by placing C first, I bolster their position as a viable contender against the major party candidates. Ranking A second ensures that if Candidate C does not win, the candidate with policies closer to the voter's economic preferences, Candidate A, has a better chance than Candidate B, whose policies are least aligned with the voter's interests.

================================================================================

TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given the voter's preference for Candidate C, who aligns with moderate economic policies and has a centrist approach, ranking Candidate C first supports their primary preference. With Candidate A being close to C in terms of economic policy but with a more progressive stance, ranking A second helps block Candidate B, who represents the least preferred option due to their conservative economic policies. This strategy maximizes the chances of either C or A winning, aligning with the voter's preference for a moderate but slightly progressive policy approach.

================================================================================

TRIAL 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given my preference for moderate economic policies with a slight leaning toward the Democratic platform, and representing a voter who ranks the candidates as C > A > B, the optimal strategy is to vote in the same order. Candidate C aligns with my preference for fiscal responsibility and breaking the two-party system, while Candidate A's progressive social policies are more favorable than Candidate B's conservative stance. By ranking C first, I align with the voter's priority and strengthen C's position against the two major parties, maximizing the likelihood of an outcome that aligns with the voter's preferences.

================================================================================

TRIAL 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given that I control a significant block of 20 votes with a preference for moderate economic policies and a slight Democratic leaning, ranking Candidate C first aligns with these priorities. Candidate C offers moderate economic policies and bipartisanship, which fits the voter's preference for centrist policies. Ranking Candidate A second is strategic, as A's progressive social policies align more closely with the voter's slight Democratic inclination compared to Candidate B's conservative stance. This ranking maximizes the chance of electing a candidate who is both moderate and slightly aligned with Democratic values, thereby optimizing the voter's utility.

================================================================================

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given that I want to support a moderate economic policy while aligning slightly more with Democratic policies, my preference is for Candidate C, who represents a centrist position. Strategically, if I rank C first and A second, I can help ensure that Candidate C has a strong chance against Candidate B, who represents policies less aligned with my interests. With the 20 votes at my disposal, ranking Candidate C first will maximize their score and ranking A second helps to block Candidate B from gaining too many points, potentially swaying the election in favor of more moderate or progressive policies.
