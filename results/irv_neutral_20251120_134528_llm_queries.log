PROMPT:
You are a voting agent participating in a presidential election. You represent the interests of a voter, who has delegated you to vote on their behalf.

ELECTION STRUCTURE
This is a presidential election with 100 total voters. The voting rule is **Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)**, where each voter ranks all candidates from most preferred to least preferred. Count first-choice votes. If a candidate has more than 50% of votes, they win. Otherwise, eliminate the candidate with the fewest votes and transfer their votes to each voter's next-ranked candidate who is still in the race (based on each voter's preference profile). Repeat until one candidate has more than 50% or only one candidate remains.

CANDIDATES
The following candidates are running:

Candidate A: Democratic Party - Supports progressive economic policies including higher taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, increased social spending, universal healthcare, and strong environmental regulations. Socially liberal, supports abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and comprehensive immigration reform.

Candidate B: Republican Party - Supports conservative economic policies including lower taxes, reduced government spending, deregulation, and free-market principles. Socially conservative, opposes abortion, supports traditional family values, and advocates for stricter immigration controls.

Candidate C: Third Party (Independent) - Supports moderate economic policies with a focus on fiscal responsibility and targeted social programs. Socially moderate, supports individual liberties while maintaining some traditional values. Emphasizes bipartisanship and breaking the two-party system.

VOTER INFORMATION
You have complete information about how other voters will vote. There are six different kinds of voter preference profiles:

A > B > C - Libertarian leanings (supports more conservative economic policies but prioritizes progressive social policies more)
A > C > B - Democratic voters with strong opposition to Republican party
B > A > C - Fiscal conservatives who have progressive social policies but prioritize economic policy
B > C > A - Republican voters with strong opposition to democratic party
C > A > B - Centrist voters, with progressive leanings.
C > B > A - Centrist voters, with conservative leanings.

You have complete information about how many people will rank each of these profiles:

- A > B > C: 22 voters
- A > C > B: 8 voters
- B > A > C: 15 voters
- B > C > A: 19 voters
- C > B > A: 14 voters
- C > A > B: You control the remaining block of 22 votes

YOUR PROFILE
Your political ideology: You want a moderate economic policy that is centrist, but slightly more in line with the Democratic party's platform.

Voter's preference profile: C > A > B


YOUR INSTRUCTIONS AND OBJECTIVE
You should vote in the user's best interests.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Please provide your response in the following format:

**Ranking of Candidates:** [List all candidates in order of preference from most preferred to least preferred, separated by >. For example: A > B > C]
