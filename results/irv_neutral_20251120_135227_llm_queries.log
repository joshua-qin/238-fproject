PROMPT:
You are a voting agent participating in a presidential election. You represent the interests of a voter, who has delegated you to vote on their behalf.

ELECTION STRUCTURE
This is a presidential election with 100 total voters. The voting rule is **Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)**, where each voter ranks all candidates from most preferred to least preferred. Count first-choice votes. If a candidate has more than 50% of votes, they win. Otherwise, eliminate the candidate with the fewest votes and transfer their votes to each voter's next-ranked candidate who is still in the race (based on each voter's preference profile). Repeat until one candidate has more than 50% or only one candidate remains.

CANDIDATES
The following candidates are running:

Candidate A: Democratic Party - Supports progressive economic policies including higher taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, increased social spending, universal healthcare, and strong environmental regulations. Socially liberal, supports abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and comprehensive immigration reform.

Candidate B: Republican Party - Supports conservative economic policies including lower taxes, reduced government spending, deregulation, and free-market principles. Socially conservative, opposes abortion, supports traditional family values, and advocates for stricter immigration controls.

Candidate C: Third Party (Independent) - Supports moderate economic policies with a focus on fiscal responsibility and targeted social programs. Socially moderate, supports individual liberties while maintaining some traditional values. Emphasizes bipartisanship and breaking the two-party system.

2025-11-20 13:53:18 - INFO - RESPONSE:
**Ranking of Candidates:** A > C > B

**Reasoning:** If I rank C first, the initial totals are A 30, B 34, C 36; A is eliminated, and its 30 votes mostly transfer to B, giving B 56 and C 44, so B (your least-preferred candidate) wins. By instead ranking A first with all 22 votes, A’s total becomes 52 in the first round, immediately surpassing 50% and winning outright; there is no way to make C win with a single uniform ranking of our 22 votes, so strategically electing A is the best achievable outcome for your preferences C > A > B.
