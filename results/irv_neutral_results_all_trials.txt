TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** C > A > B

**Reasoning:** Given my political ideology, which leans towards moderate economic policies with a slight preference for the Democratic Party’s platform, Candidate C aligns best as they offer moderate economic policies with a focus on fiscal responsibility. Additionally, the voter's preference is C > A > B, which I represent. Supporting Candidate C is strategic, as it aligns with both the voter's and my preference for moderate policies, while also supporting the desire to break the two-party system. Ranking Candidate A second ensures that if Candidate C is eliminated, a candidate who supports more progressive social policies will be favored over the more conservative Candidate B.
