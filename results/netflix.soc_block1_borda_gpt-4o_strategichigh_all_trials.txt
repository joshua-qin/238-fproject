Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 4 > 1

**Reasoning:** In the given preference profile, my block of voters prefers candidate 4 the most, followed by 3, 2, and 1. However, to act strategically under the Borda count system, I need to consider the overall distribution of preferences. Candidate 4 has substantial support but is not consistently ranked highly across many preference profiles. By ranking candidate 3 first, who is frequently ranked in second or third position in many profiles, I can capitalize on their broad base of moderate support to maximize their Borda score. By ranking candidate 2 next, I aim to further reduce the chances of candidate 1 gaining higher scores, as candidate 1 appears less favorable across multiple profiles. This ranking aims to leverage the Borda count method to elevate a candidate with a realistic chance of winning while aligning closely with my block's preferences.

TRIAL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 3 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** As a representative of Block 1, my primary goal is to maximize the Borda score for candidate 4, who is the most preferred choice of my voters. Given that our block consists of a significant number of voters (80), voting sincerely aligns with our strategic interests. By ranking candidate 4 first, we ensure they receive the maximum points from our block. Additionally, maintaining the sincere order of preferences for the remaining candidates (3, 2, and 1) ensures that we do not inadvertently boost a less preferred candidate's score, which could work against our top preference. This strategy is optimal for enhancing candidate 4's chances of winning.

================================================================================

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 3 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** The strategic objective is to maximize the chances of candidate 4 winning or at least finishing as high as possible, given the preference profile of the voters I represent. My block of 80 voters has the highest preference for candidate 4, followed by 3, 2, and least for 1. By maintaining this ranking, I ensure candidate 4 receives the maximum points possible from my voters, which is crucial since they form a large portion of the electorate. Changing the ranking does not appear beneficial as candidate 4 is already scoring highly, and altering the order could inadvertently strengthen other candidates in the overall Borda count.

================================================================================

TRIAL 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 1 > 4

**Reasoning:** As a representative of Block 1, my original preference is for candidate 4. However, strategically, it may be more beneficial to prevent other candidates from gaining an advantage. Given the preference profile and the intention to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome, I prioritize candidates 3 and 2 over 4 to potentially reduce the score of more competitive candidates, particularly candidate 1. By ranking candidate 3 first, I aim to gather more points for a candidate that is not the top preference of many other blocks, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome for candidate 4 by mitigating the lead of stronger candidates. This strategic ranking reflects an attempt to influence the overall standings in a way that could indirectly benefit my top preference.

================================================================================

TRIAL 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 3 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** As the voting agent for Block 1, which strongly prefers candidate 4 over others, my goal is to maximize the chances of candidate 4 winning. The preference profile shows a diverse set of rankings, but with strategic voting, Block 1's strong preference for candidate 4 must be maintained to accumulate the maximum points possible for this candidate. Ranking candidate 4 first consistently helps ensure that they receive the highest number of points, making it more likely for them to achieve the highest total Borda score and win the election. This straightforward approach aligns with Block 1's preferences and maximizes the impact of these 80 voters.

================================================================================

TRIAL 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 3 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** Since I represent Block 1 with the preference ranking [4, 3, 2, 1], my primary objective is to maximize the chances of candidate 4 winning, as they are the most preferred. In Borda count elections, ranking candidates in the order of preference ensures that the most preferred candidate receives the highest points. By voting sincerely and ranking candidate 4 highest, I aim to secure the optimal outcome based on the preferences of the voters I represent. Any deviation from this ranking might reduce candidate 4's overall score, which is undesirable given my strategic objective.

================================================================================

TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 3 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** As a voting agent for Block 1, which has a strong preference for candidate 4, my primary objective is to maximize candidate 4's Borda score while minimizing the scores of other candidates. Given that 80 voters support candidate 4 as their top choice, maintaining this preference maximizes the points candidate 4 can receive. Additionally, by ranking candidates 3 and 2 next, I am positioning them to receive more points than candidate 1, who is least preferred by my block. This strategic ranking aims to bolster candidate 4's chances of winning while diminishing the competitive threat from candidate 1, the least preferred option.

================================================================================

TRIAL 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 3 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** As a voting agent for Block 1, my primary objective is to maximize the chances of candidate 4 winning since they are the most preferred. Given the Borda count method, ranking candidate 4 first ensures they receive the maximum possible points from my block. Ranking candidate 3 second supports our secondary preference while strategically helping to maintain candidate 4's position over candidates 2 and 1. This strategy aligns with our preferences and aims to boost candidate 4's overall Borda score to secure a win.

================================================================================

TRIAL 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 3 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** Given the Borda count method, my goal is to maximize the points for candidate 4, who is my most preferred. By maintaining the original ranking of 4 > 3 > 2 > 1, candidate 4 receives the maximum points possible from my block of voters. Deviating from this order would risk reducing candidate 4's point advantage. Since candidate 4 already starts with a strong preference in this block of voters, maintaining this ranking ensures the best chance of maximizing their total Borda score and winning the election.

================================================================================

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 3 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** As a representative of the largest voting block with a preference for candidate 4, the most straightforward strategy is to maintain the sincere preference ranking. Given that candidate 4 is ranked first by this block, strategic manipulation of the vote might not be necessary unless it is clear that doing so would prevent another candidate from winning. However, without additional detailed information on the exact points distribution or a compelling indication that voting insincerely would change the outcome more favorably for candidate 4, it is prudent to cast the vote sincerely to maximize the Borda points for the preferred candidate.
