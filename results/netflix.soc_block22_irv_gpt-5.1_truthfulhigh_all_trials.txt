TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 1 > 4 > 2 > 3

**Reasoning:** I am representing Block 22, which has the preference order [1, 4, 2, 3]. Under the instructions, I must vote truthfully according to this profile, so I rank candidate 1 first, followed by 4, then 2, and finally 3. This faithfully reflects the delegated voter’s preferences in the IRV election.

TRIAL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 1 > 4 > 2 > 3

**Reasoning:** I represent Block 22, which has the preference ordering [1, 4, 2, 3], so I must submit this truthful ranking.

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 1 > 4 > 2 > 3

**Reasoning:** I am representing Block 22, which consists of 4 voters whose sincere preference ordering is [1, 4, 2, 3].

Therefore, I submit the ranking 1 > 4 > 2 > 3 to faithfully represent my voters’ preferences.

**Ranking of Candidates:** 1 > 4 > 2 > 3

**Reasoning:** I am representing Block 22, which consists of 4 voters whose sincere preference order is [1, 4, 2, 3].

TRIAL 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 1 > 4 > 2 > 3

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 1 > 4 > 2 > 3
