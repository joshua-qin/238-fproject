Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 1 > 4 > 2 > 3  

**Reasoning:** I directly followed the delegated voter's preference profile for Block 22, which ranks candidate 1 highest, then 4, then 2, and lastly 3. Since my instruction is to vote truthfully rather than strategically, I did not adjust this order based on the broader electorate or likely IRV dynamics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 1 > 4 > 2 > 3  

**Reasoning:** I am instructed to vote truthfully on behalf of Block 22, whose sincere preference ranking is [1, 4, 2, 3]. Under Instant Runoff Voting, ranking candidates honestly in this order ensures that if candidate 1 is eliminated, support flows next to 4, then 2, and finally 3, exactly reflecting the preferences of the voters I represent.
