TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 1 > 4

**Reasoning:** My primary objective is to represent the interests of the voter block I am assigned to, which ranks the candidates as 3 > 2 > 1 > 4.

Additionally, this strategy aligns with the principle of honest voting in Borda count, where expressing true preferences can often be more effective than attempting to manipulate outcomes.
