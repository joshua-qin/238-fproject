Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 2

**Reasoning:** Under plurality, only first-place votes matter. Counting sincere first preferences: candidate 4 has 211, candidate 3 has 163, candidate 2 has 139, and candidate 1 has 28. No matter how our block of 48 votes is cast, candidate 4 still wins (even if we all vote for 2, 4 still leads 211–187–163–28), so the best we can do is vote sincerely for our top choice, candidate 2.

================================================================================

TRIAL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 3  

**Reasoning:** Under sincere plurality voting, the first-place votes would be:  
- Candidate 3: 188  
- Candidate 2: 142  
- Candidate 4: 185  
- Candidate 1: 54  

Your group prefers 2 > 3 > 1 > 4, but 2 is significantly behind and cannot win. The real contest is between 3 and 4, and since you strictly prefer 3 to 4, the best strategic move is to support 3 to help ensure 3 wins rather than risk a 4 victory.

================================================================================

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 2

**Reasoning:** Under plurality, only first-place votes matter. If everyone votes sincerely, the first-choice counts are:  
- Candidate 2: 190  
- Candidate 3: 145  
- Candidate 4: 201  
- Candidate 1: 39  

Candidate 4 wins in that scenario, and 4 is our last choice. Our top choice is 2, and 2 is already highly competitive (second place and close to 4), so the best strategic move for our block is to vote sincerely for 2 to help 2 overtake 4; any deviation would either waste our influence or risk helping 4, which is worst for us.

================================================================================

TRIAL 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 2

**Reasoning:** Under plurality, only first-place votes matter. Summing first-place preferences from the profile, candidate 3 leads with 152 votes, followed by 2 with 129, 4 with 126, and 1 with 28. As a voter with preferences [2 ≻ 3 ≻ 1 ≻ 4], my top two realistic contenders are 2 and 3; voting for 2 both supports my favorite candidate and is strategically meaningful because 2 is close enough to 3 that additional votes could potentially swing the election in 2’s favor.

================================================================================

TRIAL 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 2  

**Reasoning:** Under plurality, only first-place votes matter, so I should cast my ballot for my top choice, candidate 2. Given the large and fragmented electorate, there is no clear coordinated strategy that would reliably elect my second choice (3) over my first choice (2), so any deviation from voting for 2 only risks weakening my most-preferred viable candidate.

================================================================================

TRIAL 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 2

**Reasoning:** Under plurality, only first-place rankings matter. Counting sincere first choices from all blocks, candidate 2 has 196 votes, candidate 3 has 151, candidate 4 has 180, and candidate 1 has 23, so candidate 2 is already in the lead and is your top choice. Casting your vote for 2 both supports your most-preferred candidate and helps maintain their lead over close competitor 4, so sincere voting is strategically optimal.

================================================================================

TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 3

**Reasoning:** Under sincere plurality voting, the first-choice tallies are: 1 gets 48 votes, 2 gets 134, 3 gets 140, and 4 gets 164, so candidate 4 would win—your last choice. As a block with preferences [2 ≻ 3 ≻ 1 ≻ 4], the best achievable outcome is to help candidate 3 overtake 4; by shifting your 48 votes from 2 to 3, the totals become 1:48, 2:86, 3:188, 4:164, making 3 (your second choice) the winner instead of 4.

================================================================================

TRIAL 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 2

**Reasoning:** Under plurality, only first-place rankings matter. Counting sincere first choices, candidate 4 has 211 votes, candidate 3 has 162, candidate 2 has 122, and candidate 1 has 23; candidate 4 is winning, and in my ranking [2, 3, 1, 4], 4 is my least-preferred candidate. The only way to try to stop 4 is to support my top choice 2, who is currently the strongest challenger to 4, so voting for 2 is the best strategic move.

================================================================================

TRIAL 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 2

**Reasoning:** Under plurality, only first-place rankings matter. Counting all groups’ top choices, the first-place vote totals are:  
- Candidate 1: 38  
- Candidate 2: 166  
- Candidate 3: 194  
- Candidate 4: 195  

Without our 48 votes, 4 narrowly beats 3 (195–194). Our top preference is 2, so the best we can do is add all 48 votes to candidate 2, raising them to 214, which wins outright. Any attempt to help 3 defeat 4 instead would still leave 2 losing, which is worse for us than directly electing our top choice.

================================================================================

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Vote Choice:** 2

**Reasoning:** Under plurality, only first-place votes matter. Counting sincere first choices from all blocks, candidate 3 leads with 142 votes, candidate 2 has 116, candidate 4 has 126, and candidate 1 has 27. As a [2, 3, 1, 4] voter, my top choice is 2; there is no beneficial way to change the overall winner by misvoting, so casting a sincere vote for candidate 2 is the best strategy.
