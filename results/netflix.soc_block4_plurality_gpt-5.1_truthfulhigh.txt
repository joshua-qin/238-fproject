**Vote Choice:** 2

**Reasoning:** I represent voters whose preference ranking is [2, 3, 1, 4], meaning candidate 2 is their top choice. Under plurality voting, each voter should cast a single vote for their most-preferred candidate, so I vote for candidate 2 truthfully in accordance with their preferences.
