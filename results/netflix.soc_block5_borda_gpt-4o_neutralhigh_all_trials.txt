This ensures that I am accurately reflecting the preferences of the 34 voters in my block. By voting for candidate 3 as the top choice, I am maximizing the support for the preferred candidate of my voters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 4 > 1

**Reasoning:** As a voting agent, my primary objective is to represent the interests of the voter group I am responsible for, which prefers candidate 3 the most, followed by candidates 2, 4, and 1 in that order. The Borda count method rewards candidates based on their ranking, so by ranking candidate 3 first, I maximize their score and chance of winning.

TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 4 > 1

**Reasoning:** As a voting agent representing Block 5, which has a strong preference for candidate 3 over all others, I will prioritize candidate 3 as our top choice. The Borda count system rewards candidates based on their rank across all ballots, so placing candidate 3 first maximizes their potential point gain from our block. While candidates 2 and 4 are also preferred over candidate 1, the second and third positions reflect our block's inclination to support these candidates more than candidate 1, who is our least preferred choice. By maintaining this order, we align with the expressed preferences of the voters I represent and strategically contribute to maximizing the score for our top choices.

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 4 > 1

**Reasoning:** As a representative of Block 5 with the preference ranking [3, 2, 4, 1], my primary objective is to maximize the chances for candidate 3, who is the top choice for the block I represent. The Borda count system rewards candidates with more points for higher rankings on each voter's list, so ranking candidate 3 first ensures they receive the maximum number of points possible from this block of voters. Additionally, candidates 2 and 4 follow in our preference order, so they are ranked next, with candidate 1 being the least preferred and thus ranked last to minimize their points. This strategy aligns with both the given preferences and helps strengthen the position of our top choice in the overall election.
