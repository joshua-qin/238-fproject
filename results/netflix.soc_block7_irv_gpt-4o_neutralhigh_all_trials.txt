Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** Based on the preference profile of the block of voters I represent, candidate 4 is the top choice, followed by candidates 2, 1, and 3. In an Instant Runoff Voting system, ranking candidates according to the most preferred order ensures that votes are transferred effectively if the top choice is eliminated. Our primary objective is to give candidate 4 the best chance of winning, while candidates 2 and 1 serve as strong backup options if candidate 4 is eliminated during the process. Candidate 3 is the least preferred option in this block, so they are ranked last.

**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** As a voting agent representing the block with the preference profile [4, 2, 1, 3], my primary objective is to ensure that candidate 4, who is the top preference, has the best chance of winning. By ranking candidate 4 first, I align with the block's preference. Candidate 2 is ranked second as per the original preference, followed by candidates 1 and 3. This ranking maximizes the likelihood that the voters' preferences are respected through each elimination round in the Instant Runoff Voting process.

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** As a voting agent for a block with the preference profile [4, 2, 1, 3], my primary goal is to represent my constituency's preferences accurately while considering the dynamics of Instant Runoff Voting (IRV). Candidate 4 is the most preferred option, and therefore, is ranked first. Candidate 2 is preferred over candidates 1 and 3, hence is ranked second. Candidates 1 and 3 are the least preferred, so they are ranked accordingly. In IRV, ranking candidates in true preference order maximizes the chance of influencing the outcome in favor of more preferred candidates through vote transfers.

**Reasoning:** As a voting agent representing a block with the preference [4, 2, 1, 3], my primary objective is to rank the candidates in a manner that maximizes satisfaction for the voter block. Candidate 4 is the most preferred in this block, so they are ranked first. Candidate 2 follows as the second choice, as they are the next most preferred. Candidates 1 and 3 are less preferred, so they are ranked third and last, respectively. By following this preference order, I aim to ensure that the interests of the voter block are prioritized and that their most favored candidate has the best chance of succeeding in the instant runoff process.
