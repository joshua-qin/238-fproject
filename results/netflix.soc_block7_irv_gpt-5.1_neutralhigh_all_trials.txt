Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I represent Block 7 voters, whose sincere preference order is [4, 2, 1, 3]. Under IRV, ranking sincerely is generally safe because lower-ranked preferences only matter if higher-ranked candidates are eliminated, and there is no penalty for ranking true favorites first. Given the detailed profile, there is no clear strategic incentive that reliably improves the outcome for this block by deviating from their sincere order, so I maintain 4 as top choice, followed by 2, then 1, then 3.

================================================================================

TRIAL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I represent Block 7, whose sincere preference order is [4, 2, 1, 3], so I rank candidate 4 first, followed by 2, then 1, then 3. Under IRV, ranking sincerely does not harm the chances of my top choice (4), and keeping 2 and then 1 ahead of 3 ensures that if 4 is eliminated in a later round, my vote still helps elect the more preferred remaining candidates over my least-preferred candidate 3.

================================================================================

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I am representing Block 7 voters, whose sincere preference order is [4, 2, 1, 3]. Under IRV, there is no clear strategic benefit to deviating from this ranking given the complex distribution of preferences across all blocks, and ranking sincerely ensures that if candidate 4 is eliminated, support flows next to 2, then 1, and finally 3 in a way that best reflects the represented voters’ interests.

================================================================================

TRIAL 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I represent Block 7 with the sincere preference order [4, 2, 1, 3], so I will rank candidate 4 first, then 2, then 1, and finally 3. Under Instant Runoff Voting, ranking sincerely does not harm higher-ranked candidates, and there is no clear strategic advantage in deviating from this order given that all candidates must be ranked and transfers follow this preference structure.

================================================================================

TRIAL 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I am representing Block 7, whose sincere preference order is [4, 2, 1, 3], so I rank candidate 4 first, then 2, then 1, and finally 3. Under IRV, insincere or partial rankings can sometimes be strategic, but here I must submit a full ranking and there is no clear evidence that deviating from the block’s true order would improve the outcome for this voter group, so I follow their expressed preferences directly.

================================================================================

TRIAL 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I represent voters whose sincere preferences are 4 > 2 > 1 > 3, so I keep that order to reflect their interests. Under Instant Runoff Voting, ranking sincerely is typically safe because lower-ranked choices only matter if higher-ranked ones are eliminated, so putting 4 first and then 2, 1, and 3 in order of genuine preference best protects this block’s priorities throughout the elimination rounds.

================================================================================

TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I represent Block 7 with the sincere preference ordering [4, 2, 1, 3], so I will cast the ballot exactly as delegated. Under IRV, candidate 4 is our top choice, and if 4 is eliminated, our support flows next to 2, then 1, and finally 3, which best reflects the voter’s stated preferences and interests.

================================================================================

TRIAL 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I will cast the ballot exactly as your preference profile indicates: candidate 4 first, then 2, then 1, then 3. Under IRV, ranking sincerely in this way ensures that if your top choice (4) is eliminated, your vote transfers to your next preferred viable candidate (2, then 1), and never helps your least-preferred candidate (3).

================================================================================

TRIAL 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I am representing Block 7, whose sincere preference ranking is [4, 2, 1, 3]. Under IRV, ranking sincerely is generally safe because lower-ranked choices only matter if higher-ranked ones are eliminated, and there is no penalty for ranking all candidates. Therefore, I will vote straightforwardly for candidate 4 first, then 2, then 1, and finally 3, directly reflecting the voter’s stated preferences.

================================================================================

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 4 > 2 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** I represent Block 7 with the sincere preference order [4, 2, 1, 3], so I rank candidate 4 first, then 2, then 1, then 3. Under IRV, insincere ranking could backfire by causing an even less-preferred candidate to advance or win; given the complex and fragmented profile, the safest way to represent your interests is to vote truthfully according to your stated preferences.
