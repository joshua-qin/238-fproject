Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3  

**Reasoning:** With everyone voting sincerely (including us as 4 > 2 > 1 > 3), the IRV process eliminates 1 first, then 2, and candidate 3 ultimately beats 4; no possible ranking of our 31 identical ballots can make 4 win, because 3 and 2 get too many favorable transfers from other voters. However, if we rank 2 above both 3 and 4, then after 1 is eliminated our 31 votes all go to 2, making 3 the next-lowest candidate and eliminating them, after which 2 soundly defeats 4 in the final round. Since our best attainable outcome is electing 2 instead of our least-preferred 3, the strategic move is to promote 2 to the top while still ranking 4 and 1 ahead of 3.

================================================================================

TRIAL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3  

**Reasoning:**  
With everyone voting sincerely, candidate 1 is always eliminated first, then candidate 2, leading to a final runoff between 3 and 4, which 3 wins—even though 3 is our least-preferred. Candidate 4 cannot win in any IRV path because 4 loses head-to-head to both 2 and 3, and we cannot save 1 from being eliminated first with only 31 votes. By ranking 2 first (and 3 last), all 31 of our ballots go to 2 in the crucial second round, making 3 the next eliminated and forcing a final 2 vs 4 runoff, which 2 wins; this changes the winner from our worst candidate (3) to our second-best (2).

================================================================================

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:** With everyone voting sincerely, the IRV process eliminates 1 first, then 2, and 3 defeats 4 in the final round—giving the presidency to our *least* preferred candidate (3). If our 31-vote block instead ranks 2 above 4 and 3, then after 1 is eliminated our votes flow to 2, causing 3 to be eliminated next; the subsequent transfers give 2 a majority over 4, making candidate 2 (our second choice) the winner, which is the best achievable outcome for us.

================================================================================

TRIAL 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3  

**Reasoning:**  
If we vote sincerely (4 > 2 > 1 > 3), the IRV process eliminates 1 and then 2, leading to a final 3 vs 4 matchup that candidate 3 wins—our worst possible outcome. By instead ranking candidate 2 first, candidate 1 is still eliminated first, but then candidate 3 becomes the lowest and is eliminated next, producing a 2 vs 4 final in which 2 wins by a clear majority. We cannot make 4 beat 3 or 2 in a head-to-head with only our 31 votes, so ensuring that candidate 2 (our second choice) wins is the best achievable strategic outcome.

================================================================================

TRIAL 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3  

**Reasoning:**  
With sincere voting (4 > 2 > 1 > 3), instant-runoff elects candidate 3, who is our least preferred. Candidate 4 cannot win under IRV because they lose head-to-head against both 2 and 3, no matter how we rank. By ranking 2 first, we shift enough support so that after candidate 1 is eliminated, candidate 3 (not 2) is eliminated in the next round, leading to a 2 vs 4 final where 2 wins—which is the best achievable outcome for us.

================================================================================

TRIAL 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:**  
If we vote sincerely as [4 > 2 > 1 > 3], IRV yields a 3 vs 4 final round in which 3 wins, and 3 is our least-preferred candidate. With our 31 votes switched to put 2 first, the first elimination remains candidate 1, but in the next round candidate 3 becomes the lowest and is eliminated, producing a 2 vs 4 final in which 2 wins (and we prefer 2 over 3). Candidate 4 cannot be made to win: among the other 501 voters, 2 and 3 both beat 4 head-to-head by margins larger than our 31 votes can overturn, so strategically electing 2 is our best achievable outcome, hence the ranking 2 > 4 > 1 > 3.

================================================================================

TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3  

**Reasoning:**  
With everyone voting sincerely, IRV elects candidate 3, who is our *least* preferred option (4 > 2 > 1 > 3). Candidate 1 is always eliminated first no matter how our block votes, so the key is what happens among {2, 3, 4} in the second round. If we keep 4 first, candidate 2 is eliminated and 3 beats 4 in the final; but if our 31 voters instead rank 2 above both 3 and 4, then 3 is eliminated second and the final becomes 2 vs 4, where the rest of the electorate makes 2 win. There is no way for our block to make 4 win, so the best attainable outcome is to strategically promote 2 to first place, keeping 4 > 1 > 3 below that, i.e., 2 > 4 > 1 > 3.

================================================================================

TRIAL 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3

**Reasoning:**  
If all voters (including our block) vote sincerely with 4 > 2 > 1 > 3, the IRV count eliminates 1 first, then 2, and in the final round candidate 3 beats 4—our least-preferred candidate wins. By instead giving all 31 of our votes to candidate 2 first (e.g., 2 > 4 > 1 > 3), 1 is still eliminated first, but then 3 becomes the lowest and is eliminated next; in the final 2 vs 4 matchup, candidate 2 wins. No ranking can make 4 beat both 2 and 3 under IRV with this profile, so securing a victory for candidate 2 (our second choice) is the best attainable strategic outcome.

================================================================================

TRIAL 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3  

**Reasoning:**  
If our block votes sincerely as 4 > 2 > 1 > 3, the IRV process ends with candidate 3 winning, who is our least-preferred option. By instead ranking candidate 2 first (e.g., 2 > 4 > 1 > 3), candidate 3 becomes the lowest after candidate 1 is eliminated and is knocked out in the second round; the final then is 2 vs. 4, and 2 wins. No ranking we choose can make 4 win, so the best achievable outcome given our preferences is to strategically elect candidate 2 and block a victory by candidate 3.

================================================================================

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 4 > 1 > 3  

**Reasoning:**  
With sincere voting (4 > 2 > 1 > 3), the IRV process ends in a 3 vs 4 runoff, and 3 beats 4 head‑to‑head, so our top choice 4 cannot win under any strategy. However, by switching our 31 ballots to rank 2 first and 3 last (e.g., 2 > 4 > 1 > 3), the second-round tallies after candidate 1 is eliminated become 2:188, 3:160, 4:184, so candidate 3 is eliminated instead of 2. The final runoff is then 2 vs 4, and since a majority of voters prefer 2 to 4, candidate 2 wins—our second-best outcome and strictly better for us than the sincere-result winner, candidate 3.
