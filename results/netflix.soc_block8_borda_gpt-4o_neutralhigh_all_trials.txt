TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 4 > 2 > 1

**Reasoning:** As a voting agent, my primary objective is to accurately represent the preferences of the voter block that delegated me to vote on their behalf. The given ranking from the block I represent is [3, 4, 2, 1], indicating a clear preference for candidate 3 as the most preferred, followed by candidates 4, 2, and 1 in that order. To ensure that the voting reflects the interests of the voters I represent, I will maintain their expressed preference order. This approach aligns with the principle of accurately representing voter preferences in the Borda count system, which rewards candidates based on their position in each voter's ranking.

My primary objective is to maximize the points for candidate 3, who is ranked highest in the given profile. By maintaining the initial preference order, I ensure that candidate 3 receives the most points, thus increasing their chances of securing a higher Borda count relative to other candidates. This strategy aligns with the voter's expressed preferences and optimizes the likelihood of a favorable election outcome for them.

By ranking Candidate 3 first, I align with the voters' interests and increase the likelihood of Candidate 3 receiving the maximum Borda points from this block. Ranking Candidate 4 next respects the voters' second preference, while Candidates 2 and 1 are ranked third and fourth, respectively, in line with the given profile. This strategy effectively supports the voters' preferences and maximizes the impact of their votes under the Borda count system.

TRIAL 10

In the Borda count system, ranking candidates according to this order maximizes the score for our top choice (candidate 3) and aligns with the strategic objective of supporting our most preferred candidates. This approach ensures that our preference is expressed effectively while still adhering to the established ranking order of the block.
