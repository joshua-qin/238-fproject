Results from 10 trials
================================================================================

TRIAL 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 4 > 1  

**Reasoning:** Under sincere voting (3 > 4 > 2 > 1) candidate 4 is the clear Borda winner, with 3 in a distant second. Given the existing profile, no plausible reordering by our block can make 3 win, or even overtake 4, but by ranking 2 second and pushing 4 down to third we slightly reduce 4’s margin while keeping 3 first; ranking 1 last is consistent with our least-preferred status for that candidate and does not harm our objectives.

================================================================================

TRIAL 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 2 > 1 > 3 > 4  

**Reasoning:** Under sincere voting (3 > 4 > 2 > 1), candidate 4 wins, which is our *least* preferred outcome. By instead ranking 2 first and 1 second, and pushing 3 and 4 to the bottom, our 29-vote block shifts enough Borda points to make candidate 2 the winner. Candidate 2 is our third choice, but this strategic vote prevents the much worse outcome of candidate 4 winning, and no alternative ranking can realistically elect our top choice (3) or second choice (4) without risking 4’s victory.

================================================================================

TRIAL 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 4 > 1 > 2

**Reasoning:**  
Under sincere voting your block prefers 3 > 4 > 2 > 1. Computing the Borda totals from the given profile (excluding your 29 voters), candidate 3 is already the clear leader, followed by 4, then 2, then 1. Casting your ballots sincerely as [3, 4, 2, 1] only increases 3’s margin and does not change the winner. However, if you instead rank [3, 4, 1, 2], you still give 3 and 4 the same points as under sincerity, but you *reduce* candidate 2’s Borda score relative to 1, weakening a less-preferred rival without risking 3’s victory. This is a safe, strategically beneficial deviation.

================================================================================

TRIAL 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 4 > 2 > 1  

**Reasoning:** Under Borda with this large, detailed profile, the effect of changing just our block of 29 ballots is limited and unlikely to flip the overall outcome in a way that clearly benefits us by demoting our top choice. Without a clear, calculable opportunity to help candidate 4 over 3 (our favorite) or to block a strongly leading disliked candidate, the safest strategy is to vote sincerely: ranking 3 first, then 4, then 2, and finally 1.

================================================================================

TRIAL 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 4 > 1 > 2

**Reasoning:** Under sincere voting (3 > 4 > 2 > 1), candidate 4 wins, but 3 is our top choice and can overtake 4 if we demote 2 instead of 1. By ranking 1 above 2, we reduce candidate 2’s Borda score (a strong competitor to 3) while leaving 4’s relative position unchanged, which shifts enough points for candidate 3 to narrowly win. This ballot is the best strategic compromise: it sacrifices sincerity on the lower ranks to elect our favorite candidate 3.

================================================================================

TRIAL 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 4 > 2 > 1  

**Reasoning:**  
Under Borda, your block of 29 voters is too small relative to the whole electorate for any reversal of your true ranking to change the identity of the winner; shifting your votes only very slightly changes total scores and does not enable candidate 3 or 4 to overtake the current front-runners. Since no profitable manipulation is available, the best strategy is to vote sincerely, ranking your most preferred candidate (3) first, followed by 4, then 2, and placing your least preferred candidate (1) last.

================================================================================

TRIAL 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 4 > 1  

**Reasoning:**  
Given the full profile, candidate 4 is the current Borda leader, with 3 somewhat behind, then 2, and 1 far last. Our sincere ranking is 3 > 4 > 2 > 1, but if we rank 4 second we help the current front-runner defeat our top choice. By ranking 3 first and 4 third (3 > 2 > 4 > 1), we maximize 3’s relative gain over 4 while still keeping 2 ahead of 4, which best serves our preferences among realistically competitive candidates.

================================================================================

TRIAL 8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 4 > 2 > 1  

**Reasoning:** Under sincere voting (3 > 4 > 2 > 1 for your block), candidate 3 already wins the Borda count by a large margin over all others. Any attempt to raise 4 or 2 higher, or to demote 3, would only risk reducing 3’s lead or helping a rival without improving your top choice’s chances. Since your most-preferred candidate is safely winning, the best strategic move is to vote sincerely with 3 at the top.

================================================================================

TRIAL 9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 4 > 2 > 1  

**Reasoning:** Under Borda, I checked how our block of 29 voters could affect the outcome by hypothetically moving our 29 votes among all possible rankings. In every case, candidate 3 still wins by a large margin, and candidate 4 remains a clear second, so no strategic misranking can improve the final outcome for us. Since manipulation cannot help, we should vote sincerely according to our true preferences: 3 > 4 > 2 > 1.

================================================================================

TRIAL 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ranking of Candidates:** 3 > 2 > 4 > 1  

**Reasoning:** Under sincere voting your block prefers 3 > 4 > 2 > 1, but candidate 4 is already very strong and close to winning, while 3 is significantly behind in Borda points. By ranking 2 second and pushing 4 down to third, you help build a broader anti-4 coalition while still keeping 3 clearly ahead; this maximizes the chance of avoiding your worst outcome (1 or especially 4 winning) while preserving as much support as possible for your top choice, 3.
