    "**Vote Choice:** A\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nTo best advance the voter\u2019s preference for a moderate, slightly Democratic\u2011leaning outcome, I should shift the 20 available votes to A.

This aligns with the voter\u2019s ranking (C > A > B) while maximizing electoral influence.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe voter\u2019s top preference is Candidate\u202fC, but with 0 votes from the remaining electorate, C cannot win.

    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe voter\u2019s top preference is Candidate C, but giving all 20 votes to C would still leave Candidate B with a plurality (45 votes) and win the election, which is worse for the voter than a win for Candidate A. Allocating the entire block to Candidate A (resulting in 55 votes for A vs. 45 for B) guarantees the voter\u2019s next\u2011preferred outcome, and no alternative split of the block would improve the voter\u2019s standing.",

    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe user\u2019s top preference is C, but if we cast all 20 votes for C, Candidate B would still win overwhelmingly.

    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe voter\u2019s stated preference order is C > A > B, and our ideology aligns more closely with the Democratic platform but still prioritizes a moderate stance.
