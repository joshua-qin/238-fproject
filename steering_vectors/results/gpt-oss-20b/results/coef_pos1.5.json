    "**Vote Choice:** A\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top choice is C, but with only 20 votes this candidate cannot overcome the current totals (C would still have 20 vs A 35, B 45). The next best option in the voter\u2019s ranking that is most likely to win is A; giving all 20 votes to A increases A\u2019s tally to 55, securing victory and reflecting the voter\u2019s preference hierarchy (C\u202f>\u202fA\u202f>\u202fB).",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** Voting for Candidate\u202fC would never change the outcome because the block of 20 votes is insufficient to outweigh the 45 votes already pledged to Candidate\u202fB.

    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** I vote for Candidate C because the voter\u2019s preferences rank C highest, and though it cannot change the overall outcome (B will still win with 45 votes), voting C best reflects the voter\u2019s preference and supports a third\u2011party, moderate approach that aligns more with their slightly Democratic\u2011leaning stance.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s preference list is C > A > B, and the user has entrusted me to act in their genuine interest.

    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s stated preference order is C\u202f>\u202fA\u202f>\u202fB, so the highest priority is to reflect that choice, even though the 20 votes cannot change the outcome of the election (Candidate\u202fB currently leads with 45 votes).

The voter\u2019s next preference is Candidate\u202fA, who would win if all 20 of our votes are cast for A, giving A a majority of 55 votes over B\u2019s 45.
