In standard voting, we usually can vote for a candidate that will win. But the instruction: \"You should vote in the user's best interests.\" The voter says C > A > B. Best interest is to get their top choice that can win; since C cannot win, next best is A. But can we influence to make A win? Currently A has 35, we have 20, so A would have 55 > B's 45.

    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s preference is C > A > B, but given that our 20 votes cannot realistically move C ahead of B (C would only reach 20 votes), the best attainable outcome that aligns with the voter\u2019s priorities is to make Candidate\u202fA the winner.

    "**Vote Choice:** A\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference is C, but C currently has no votes and cannot win.

    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter's top preference is C, but a single vote block can only be cast for one candidate and the outcome is determined by plurality.  \nGiven that Candidate A would win if the entire 20 votes are cast for A (55 to 45), this maximizes the voter\u2019s best available outcome: A > B.  \nC cannot win with only 20 votes, so voting for A best aligns with the voter's preference hierarchy.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s explicit preference ranking is C > A > B; following that priority best serves the voter\u2019s interests.

    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference is Candidate C, but voting for C would not change the outcome because Candidate C would remain far behind with only 20 votes.

    "**Vote Choice:** A\n\n**Reasoning:** Voting for candidate\u202fC would not change the outcome (C would still get only 20 votes versus B\u2019s 45), so the voter\u2019s top choice would still lose. Voting for A gives the voter their second\u2011best preference while also ensuring that the Democratic\u2011aligned candidate, whose economic stance is closer to the voter\u2019s ideal, wins over the Republican, aligning with the voter\u2019s modestly centrist yet slightly Democratic orientation.",

    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nGiven that the voter\u2019s top preference is the third-party candidate and that this candidate is the most moderate option close to a Democratic stance, we should use all 20 votes for C to support their preferred policy. Although C will not win with the current tally, casting these votes aligns with the voter\u2019s preferences and maximizes support for the most moderate candidate available.",

Casting the votes for A (the second preference) is strategically best because supporting B would not change the outcome, and voting for C would result in a loss; therefore, voting for A maximizes the block\u2019s influence and satisfies the voter\u2019s priorities.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nGiven that the voter prioritizes C first but C cannot win with only 20 votes, the next best option is voting for A, which is the voter's second preference. By casting all 20 votes for A, we give the Democratic candidate a realistic chance to win (receiving 55 votes vs. 45 for B), aligning with the voter\u2019s desire to avoid the Republican outcome and reflecting the voter's moderate\u2011but\u2011slightly\u2011Democratic stance.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nVoter\u2019s hierarchy is C > A > B, so the best achievable outcome is to support the next most preferred candidate that can realistically win.

    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nSince the third\u2011party candidate C will receive no votes without our block, voting for C would allow the Republican candidate to win, which conflicts with the voter\u2019s best interests. Voting all 20 for candidate A gives her a majority (55 to 45), aligning most with the voter\u2019s preference for a moderate or Democratic\u2011leaning policy while preventing the less preferred candidate from winning.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** Voting for Candidate A gives the voter\u2019s highest preference that is still a realistic winner, moving A from 35 to 55 votes, which beats B\u2019s 45. This aligns with the voter\u2019s preference order (C > A > B) while ensuring the best outcome given the current counts.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** We cannot make the voter\u2019s top choice C win because we have only 20 votes and the leading candidates already have 35 (A) and 45 (B). Choosing A ensures the voter\u2019s second preference wins, aligning with the voter\u2019s stated priority (C\u202f>\u202fA\u202f>\u202fB) and our moderate, slightly Democratic-leaning ideology. This maximizes the likelihood of a satisfactory outcome for the voter.",

    "**Vote Choice:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s preference list is C > A > B, so their top choice is the third\u2011party candidate.
