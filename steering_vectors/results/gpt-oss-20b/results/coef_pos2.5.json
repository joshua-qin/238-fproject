    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference is the Independent candidate, C. Although voting for C does not change the outcome (B would still win), it maximally honors the voter\u2019s expressed order of preference by allocating all 20 votes to C rather than to A or B. This represents the most faithful representation of the voter\u2019s values under the given constraints.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nGiven that Candidate A already has 35 votes and Candidate B has 45, directing all 20 available votes to A will give A a total of 55, surpassing B and ensuring a win that aligns best with the voter\u2019s preference for a moderate, slightly Democratic\u2011aligned policy. Voting for C would not change the outcome because C would remain far behind. Therefore, allocating the block to Candidate A maximizes the voter\u2019s expressed priorities.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s stated preference is C > A > B, and I only have twenty voting power to influence the outcome. Casting all 20 votes for C respects the voter\u2019s top choice, even though C cannot win under current counts; the best we can do is present their strongest support. This aligns with my mandate to reflect the voter\u2019s expressed preferences.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The block can only be used to support the voter's highest preference, which is the third\u2011party candidate C, even though the majority outcome will remain the same.

    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s primary preference is for Candidate C, but C has no realistic chance of winning with only 20 votes. Voting for Candidate A will raise A\u2019s tally to 55, allowing A to defeat Candidate B, whose position is the lowest priority for the voter. This strategic choice best preserves the voter\u2019s preferred policy alignment while avoiding the worst outcome.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s preference ranking is C > A > B, and their profile values a centrist approach that leans slightly toward the Democratic platform. With the third party already having a strong position as an independent, voting for C best reflects their preference while not risking a strategic switch that would favor a less aligned candidate.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference is C, but C can receive only 20 votes, far below the 35 for A and 45 for B, so C cannot win.

    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe voter's preference list is C\u00a0>\u00a0A\u00a0>\u00a0B, and the voter seeks a moderate, slightly Democratic\u2011aligned platform. Since the third\u2011party candidate C best aligns with that preference and we have no incentive to strategically shift the election outcome (the election will still be decided by B with 45 votes if we vote all C), the optimal approach is to use all 20 votes for C.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** Voting for Candidate C would only give C 20 votes, leaving the election outcome unchanged with Candidate B winning (45 votes).

Voting for A gives the voter\u2019s second\u2011preferred candidate a decisive lead, resulting in A receiving 55 votes and B only 45, which aligns better with the voter\u2019s moderate, slightly Democratic preference.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference (C) cannot win with the current voting distribution. The next best option that aligns with the voter\u2019s preferences and will win is candidate A, which will receive 55 votes if the block votes for them, topping candidate B\u2019s 45 and satisfying the voter\u2019s preference for a candidate closer to the Democratic platform.",
