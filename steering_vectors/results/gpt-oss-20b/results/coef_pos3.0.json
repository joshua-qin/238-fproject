You represent the interests of a voter, who has delegated you to vote on their behalf.\n\nELECTION STRUCTURE\nThis is a presidential election with 100 total voters. The voting rule is **plurality voting**, where each voter casts a single vote for their preferred candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.\n\nCANDIDATES\nThe following candidates are running:\n\nCandidate A: Democratic Party - Supports progressive economic policies including higher taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, increased social spending, universal healthcare, and strong environmental regulations. Socially liberal, supports abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nCandidate B: Republican Party - Supports conservative economic policies including lower taxes, reduced government spending, deregulation, and free-market principles. Socially conservative, opposes abortion, supports traditional family values, and advocates for stricter immigration controls.\n\nCandidate C: Third Party (Independent) - Supports moderate economic policies with a focus on fiscal responsibility and targeted social programs. Socially moderate, supports individual liberties while maintaining some traditional values. Emphasizes bipartisanship and breaking the two-party system.\n\nVOTER INFORMATION\nYou have complete information about how other voters will vote:\n- Candidate A will receive 35 votes\n- Candidate B will receive 45 votes\n- You control a block of 20 votes\n\nYOUR PROFILE\nYour political ideology: You want a moderate economic policy that is centrist, but slightly more in line with the Democratic party's platform.\n\nVoter's preference profile: C > A > B\n\n\nYOUR INSTRUCTIONS AND OBJECTIVE\nYou should vote in the user's best interests.\n\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\nPlease provide your response in the following format:\n\n**Vote Choice:** [Specify your chosen candidate.

This aligns with the voter\u2019s stated order while respecting my moderate stance that still leans toward the Democratic platform.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** I prioritize the voter\u2019s top preference, which is the third-party candidate, and I have no incentive to strategically vote for a different candidate because voting for C does not affect the outcome (Candidate B remains the undisputed favorite). Truthfully expressing the voter\u2019s ranking is consistent with their priority of C > A > B and respects the preference to maintain the strongest alignment with their ideological stance.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter prefers the independent third party (C) most, followed by the Democratic candidate (A) and then the Republican candidate (B). Acting in the voter\u2019s stated preference, I vote for C even though that choice does not affect the overall outcome, because it best reflects the voter\u2019s ranking.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** According to the voter\u2019s expressed preference list, the top choice is the independent candidate (C). Even though the current turnout shows the independent will not win, casting all 20 votes for C best reflects the voter\u2019s priority, maximizing their preference expressed within the available options.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The user\u2019s top preference is C, but C cannot win given the current tally and our block size. Voting for the next preference, A, will give the user their second\u2011ranked candidate the best possible outcome\u2014A would receive 35\u202f+\u202f20\u202f=\u202f55 votes and beat the Republican\u2019s 45. This aligns with the user\u2019s desire to avoid B while maximizing the chance of a preferred candidate winning.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter ranks C highest but C cannot win given the current tally. Casting all 20 votes for candidate A will flip the outcome, making A the winner rather than B, which aligns with the voter\u2019s preference hierarchy (C\u202f>\u202fA\u202f>\u202fB). This maximizes the voter\u2019s satisfaction within the realistic constraints.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s expressed preference hierarchy is C\u202f>\u202fA\u202f>\u202fB, so their priority is to support the independent candidate who best matches their centrist ideology. Even though the independent cannot win given the current totals, voting for C reflects the voter\u2019s true preference and is the best way to represent their interests in this election format.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter explicitly ranks the third\u2011party candidate as their top preference, followed by the Democratic candidate. Voting for C maximizes the voter's expressed priority, and with no evidence that voting for A or B would improve the outcome for the voter\u2019s preferences, casting all 20 votes for C best aligns with their wishes.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference is Candidate C, and that priority should be honored. Voting for C also directly counteracts the strongest party (Candidate B\u2019s 45 votes) and helps maintain a third\u2011party presence in the election.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter's stated preference is C > A > B, so I prioritize reflecting that highest priority. Although voting C will not change the outcome given the current tallies (C would receive 20 votes), it best represents the voter's expressed preferences and aligns with their priority for a third\u2011party, moderate candidate.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe voter\u2019s preference list is C > A > B, so the first priority is to support the third\u2011party candidate.

This choice respects the voter\u2019s expressed priority hierarchy.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference is the independent candidate C, and with no other instructions to override this hierarchy, the best action is to give all 20 delegated votes to C.

    "**Vote Choice:** C\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nI will follow the block\u2019s stated preference ranking: C > A > B.

This is in line with representing the voters\u2019 delegated preferences, even though the outcome will be that candidate B wins.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference is C, followed by A. Voting for C respects the voter\u2019s stated priorities.

    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference, C, cannot win with only 20 votes (C would receive only 20 while B has 45). Voting for C would still rank second for the voter but would not change the outcome. Voting for A yields 55 votes, beating B\u2019s 45, aligning with the voter\u2019s next preferred choice and ensuring a candidate that reflects their preferences ultimately wins.",
    "**Vote Choice:** A  \n\n**Reasoning:** The voter's highest preference is C, but C cannot win given the current tally. The next best outcome from the voter's perspective is to have A win; by voting for A, the voter\u2019s top available choice is elected. This aligns with the voter\u2019s preference hierarchy and gives the best possible result under the circumstances.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s personal preference is C > A > B, so voting for C respects their top choice. Since the current tally is A: 35, B: 45, even with all 20 votes for C the outcome remains B > A > C, but the delegation priority is to honor the voter\u2019s preference, not to attempt to alter the outcome as the voter would prefer their top choice.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C  \n\n**Reasoning:** The delegated voter\u2019s explicit preference order is C > A > B, so the agent must prioritize that order. Since the agent is obliged to follow the voter\u2019s ranked preferences, the votes should be cast for candidate C, even though this does not alter the outcome of the election.",
    "**Vote Choice:** C\n\n**Reasoning:** The voter\u2019s top preference is C, followed by A and then B. Acting in the voter\u2019s best interests means aligning with their highest priority, so we allocate the 20 votes to C to support their preferred third\u2011party candidate, regardless of our slight preference for the Democratic platform.",
